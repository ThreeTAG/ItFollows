Based on the cult classic movie of the same name, It Follows introduces a paranormal stalker to the game, known only as “The Entity,” in the form of a curse that is acquired when the player becomes overly greedy while looting ancient cities.

If the player is brave enough, they can venture down into an Ancient City, endure the perils of the Warden, hostile mobs, and eventually come across a new structure known as the “Ancient Burial Chamber,” which contains the remains of the city's long-passed residents.

In the centre should be a small black urn with a face on it. This urn contains very valuable loot that the player may take, but must be careful, as doing so will increase their risk of receiving the curse.

Upon receiving the curse, you will now have the Paranormal Stalker, known as The Entity, following you at all times. It will not stop, it cannot be stopped, it will only pursue you until you die by its hands. 
If you try to run away, it will follow, navigating cliffs, rivers, water, and any terrain. 
If you try to shut yourself in, it will open the door. If you barricade the door, it will break the walls around you. If you try to isolate yourself in the skies, it will build a tower to get to you.

It can disguise itself as anything that helps it get closer to you. At day, a pig, a cow, even a horse. 
At night? Zombies, skeletons, creepers, Endermen. Sometimes maybe even villagers…

It cannot be killed. Only hit, and maybe even occasionally stunned. Only the person with the curse can see it, but it can still be interacted with by people who do not have the curse, as it exists physically. 

Which brings us to the next section…

As the creature cannot be killed by known means, the only options are to endure it hunting you for the rest of your blocky life, OR throw the curse onto another poor sap.

To pass the curse on, you must brew a potion of spreading. You can do this by using echo shards in a brewing stand. 
You must then find someone and simply throw it… once done, you will know by the advancement. Please note that although you may have passed The Entity on, you will still be able to see it just now It Follows the person you have spread it to. 

However, you'd better hope and pray that the person you passed it to passes it to someone else, if they die, The Entity will come right back looking for you…
